This is my first individual school project. I wanted to create a simple site for my psychic life coach practice. 
Very basic, navigate between three offered sections and can make use of a contact form. 
Html, CSS, and Bootstrap. 
1. I would like to have three-five html pages as opposed to three html sections. 
2. Need more images 
3. I would like the video and subscribe buttons to be functionable. 
4. Add more content. Bio, Services, Testimonials, Social Media Links, more personable, What can the user gain from working with me? Am I sharing enough of my story with them? Is this sight pleasing to look at? Inviting?
